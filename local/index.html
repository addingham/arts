	Addingham is a village nestled at the start of Upper Wharfedale in the Yorkshire Dales, one of the most beautiful areas in the country. 
	Upstream are Bolton Abbey, a favourite of Turner, and Burnsall, probably the most painted village in the Dales. Downstream are the bright lights of Ilkley, and the famous moor dominates much of the view from Addingham.
	</p>
	<p>
	There's plenty of creativity to be seen in the area, stretching from the Bronze Age "<A href="http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/rombaldsmoor.htm">Cup and Ring Marks</A>" of the Moor, some of 
	Britain's oldest rock art, through to modern pieces like local artist Graeme Willson's 
	<A href="https://www.notjusthockney.info/willson-graeme/">Madonna of the Moors</A> in Ilkley's St Margaret's Church. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In Addingham, we have work ranging from 3000 year old rock art to work by modern artists such as sculptor 
	<A href="http://www.fionabowley.com/?page_id=918">Fiona Bowley</A>. Our church contains Saxon Crosses, rough-hewn folk-art 
faces, and work by Arts and Crafts

once home to the Sisters of Mercy's Craig Adams, has a thriving music scene, centred on <A href="https://www.swan-addingham.co.uk/events/">The Swan</A> pub.
